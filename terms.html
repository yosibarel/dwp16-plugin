            <h2>License Agreement</h2>
            <p>
                The DWP-16 Plugin is licensed to you, not sold. Your use of the plugin is subject to the terms outlined in this agreement. 
                You may not copy, distribute, modify, or resell the software without explicit written permission from the developer.
            </p>
            <p>
                Each license is valid for use on a single device. Should you need to activate the plugin on a different device, you are permitted to perform a <strong>reactivation</strong> using your license key up to <strong>10 times</strong>. Exceeding this limit will require the purchase of an additional license or contacting our support team for further assistance.
            </p>

            <h2>License Reactivation</h2>
            <p>
                The DWP-16 Plugin license is valid for use on a single device. If you need to activate the plugin on a different device, you may perform a <strong>reactivation</strong> using your license key up to <strong>10 times</strong>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Upon reactivation, the new device will be registered with your license key, and the plugin will recognize the new device as the active one. 
            </p>
            <p>
                To reactivate your license on a new device, please follow these steps:
                <ol>
                    <li>Install the DWP-16 Plugin on the new device.</li>
                    <li>Enter your license key to activate the plugin.</li>
                </ol>
            </p>
            <p>
                If you exceed the 10 reactivation attempts, you will be required to purchase an additional license or contact our support team for further assistance.
            </p>
            <p>
                We reserve the right to monitor license activations and enforce these limits to prevent unauthorized use.
