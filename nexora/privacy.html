            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                Welcome to the <strong>Nexora Plugin</strong> Privacy Policy. As an independent developer, I prioritize
                your privacy and data protection. You can use my audio effect plugin and visit the website without
                providing personal information. However, certain services, like license activation or purchases, require
                the collection and processing of personal data. In such cases, your consent will be requested before
                processing.
