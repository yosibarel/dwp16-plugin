            <p>
                Welcome to the <strong>Nexora Plugin</strong>. By accessing or using this software, you acknowledge that
                you have read, understood, and agreed to be bound by these Terms of Service.
                If you do not agree to these terms, you may not use the plugin.
            </p>
            <p>
                Nexora is an audio effect plugin designed to run inside compatible digital audio workstations (DAWs). It
                is not a standalone application and requires a host environment to function.

            <h2>License Agreement</h2>
            <p>
                The Nexora Plugin is licensed to you, not sold. Your use of the plugin is subject to the terms outlined
                in this agreement.
                You may not copy, distribute, modify, or resell the software without explicit written permission from
                the developer.
            </p>
            <p>
                Each license is valid for use on a single device. Should you need to activate the plugin on a different
                device, you are permitted to perform an <strong>activation</strong> using your license key. Once
                activated on a new device, the plugin will no longer be available on the previous device.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>License activation and validation require an internet connection (periodically).</strong>
            </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Permitted Use</h2>
            <p>
                The Nexora Plugin is intended for personal or commercial use in music production projects as an audio
                effect within a DAW.
                Any other use, including reverse engineering, unauthorized distribution, or creating derivative works,
                is strictly prohibited.
            </p>

        <section>
            <h2>Refund Policy</h2>
            <p>
                We offer a 14-day refund policy for purchases made directly through our website, provided the plugin has
                not been activated or used.
                To request a refund, please contact us at <a href="mailto:dwp@dwp-plugin.com">dwp@dwp-plugin.com</a>

            <h2>Limitation of Liability</h2>
            <p>
                The Nexora Plugin is provided "as is," without warranty of any kind, express or implied. The developer
                is not liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, or consequential damages arising from the use or
                inability to use the plugin.

            <h2>License Reactivation</h2>
            <p>
                The Nexora Plugin license is valid for use on a single device. If you need to activate the plugin on a
                different device, you may perform an <strong>activation</strong> using your license key.
            </p>
            <p>
                Upon activation, the new device will be registered with your license key, and the plugin will
                recognize the new device as the active one.
            </p>
            <p>
                To activate your license on a new device, please follow these steps:
            </p>
            <p>1. Install the Nexora Plugin on the new device inside your DAW.</p>
            <p>2. Enter your license key to activate the plugin.</p>
            <p>
                We reserve the right to monitor license activations to prevent unauthorized use.
            </p>

        <section>
            <h2>Termination</h2>
            <p>
                This license will automatically terminate if you fail to comply with any of its terms. Upon termination,
                you must cease all use of the plugin and destroy all copies in your possession.
                The developer reserves the right to disable your license in case of non-compliance.
