                    <h3>Glitch Grid with 10 FX Tracks</h3>
                    <p>
                        Nexora is built around a powerful FX grid where each row is an independent track. You get up to
                        10 tracks, and every track can host up to 4 effects from a rich collection including step
                        filter, distortion, chorus, phaser, flanger, filter, delay, reverb, repeat, reverse, pitch drop,
                        gate, pan, shuffle, bitcrusher, ringmod, fracture, stretcher, rotary and comb. Draw patterns on
                        the grid and let Nexora slice, glitch and reshape your audio in time.

                    <h3>Snapshots Per Pattern for Deep Control</h3>
                    <p>
                        Every effect on every track supports up to 8 snapshots, so each pattern on the grid can recall
                        its own unique parameter set. Design evolving textures by assigning different snapshots across
                        the grid, switching between subtle movement and extreme glitch transformations without losing
                        control. A dedicated snapshot edit mode lets you fine-tune all FX parameters quickly and
                        musically.

                    <p>
                        Nexora’s grid supports up to 8 divisions and 8 beats, giving you a total of 64 steps that span
                        two bars. Choose between four play modes: Parallel (process all active tracks together),
                        Sequential (play one track per row then advance), Random Step (jump to a random track after a
                        configurable number of steps from 1–32) and Mixdown mode for special routing. These modes let
                        you move from tight rhythmic glitches to chaotic, evolving FX structures.

                    <h3>Intelligent Randomization Engine</h3>
                    <p>
                        Nexora features a powerful random system on both global and per-track levels. Use global random
                        to fill the grid with patterns, snapshots, effects and play modes, with precise control over
                        what is allowed to change and what stays locked. Define which effect types can be used and how
                        much of the grid should be filled. Each track also has its own random buttons for patterns and
                        FX (including optional snapshot randomization), making it easy to discover new ideas in seconds.

                    <p>
                        Shape your mix with per-track mix and pan controls, plus global mix and pan on the master. Each
                        track can be renamed and given its own color, and Nexora’s foreground theme color can be
                        customized to match your project or aesthetic. On top of the track FX, a dedicated master FX
                        section provides up to 4 effects that are not affected by randomization, perfect for final glue
                        and polish.

                    <p>
                        Capture the output of Nexora directly with the integrated recorder. Use manual mode for instant
                        recording or enable auto mode with threshold so recording starts only when your signal is loud
                        enough. When you are done, drag the waveform straight to your DAW or save it as an audio file
                        for later use. It’s an ideal workflow for printing complex glitch passages and resampling them
                        into your tracks.
